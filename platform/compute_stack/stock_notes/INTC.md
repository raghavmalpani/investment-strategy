### Scoring (Growth-Focused Framework)
- AI Revenue Growth & Monetization: 3/5 (Weight: 2.0) = 6.0
- Competitive Positioning: 2/5 (Weight: 2.0) = 4.0
- Strategic Moats: 2/5 (Weight: 1.5) = 3.0
- Execution & Regulatory Risk: 2/5 (Weight: 1.0) = 2.0
- Capital Efficiency: 1/5 (Weight: 0.5) = 0.5
- Valuation as Thesis Discount: 4/5 (Weight: 0.5) = 2.0
**Total: 2.33 / 5**

### Key Points
- **AI Revenue:** Gaudi 3 at IBM; 18A ramping H2 2025; $5B Nvidia foundry win
- **Positioning:** Multi-generation behind NVDA/TSM; foundry unproven
- **Moats:** X86 legacy but no AI ecosystem; foundry thesis speculative
- **Valuation:** Negative P/E = massive thesis discount IF 18A succeeds; high risk/reward
- **Risks:** Negative profitability (-39% net margin); foundry execution critical

### Trigger Flags
- [x] Restructuring (negative profitability)
- [x] 18A foundry ramp execution risk
- [x] Negative cash burn
