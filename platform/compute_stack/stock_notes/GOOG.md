### Scoring (Growth-Focused Framework)
- AI Revenue Growth & Monetization: 5/5 (Weight: 2.0) = 10.0
- Competitive Positioning: 4/5 (Weight: 2.0) = 8.0
- Strategic Moats: 4/5 (Weight: 1.5) = 6.0
- Execution & Regulatory Risk: 3/5 (Weight: 1.0) = 3.0
- Capital Efficiency: 4/5 (Weight: 0.5) = 2.0
- Valuation as Thesis Discount: 4/5 (Weight: 0.5) = 2.0
**Total: 4.13 / 5**

### Key Points
- **AI Revenue:** Vertex AI 20x YoY growth, 4M devs; Ironwood TPU (7th-gen) launched
- **Positioning:** Custom TPU pipeline + Gemini integration; strong but NVDA dependency remains
- **Moats:** Search data moat + developer ecosystem; agentic systems leadership emerging
- **Valuation:** P/E 25x, PEG 5.5x = thesis moderately priced; upside if Gemini gains share
- **Risks:** Regulatory scrutiny; heavy capex drag on FCF

### Trigger Flags
- [x] Antitrust/regulatory risk
- [x] AI capex impacting FCF (-11% YoY)
