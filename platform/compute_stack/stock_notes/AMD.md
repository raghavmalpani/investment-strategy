### Scoring (Growth-Focused Framework)
- AI Revenue Growth & Monetization: 4/5 (Weight: 2.0) = 8.0
- Competitive Positioning: 3/5 (Weight: 2.0) = 6.0
- Strategic Moats: 3/5 (Weight: 1.5) = 4.5
- Execution & Regulatory Risk: 2/5 (Weight: 1.0) = 2.0
- Capital Efficiency: 2/5 (Weight: 0.5) = 1.0
- Valuation as Thesis Discount: 2/5 (Weight: 0.5) = 1.0
**Total: 3.00 / 5**

### Key Points
- **AI Revenue:** MI300 strong demand, hyperscaler wins building; but growth inconsistent
- **Positioning:** Playing catch-up to NVDA; ROCm ecosystem nascent
- **Moats:** Design wins at major cloud but no software lock-in depth
- **Valuation:** P/E 93x, PEG 3.4x = thesis substantially priced despite weak profitability
- **Risks:** $1.5B inventory write-down; margin compression; China exposure

### Trigger Flags
- [x] $1.5B inventory charge Q2
- [x] China export controls ($1.5B)
- [x] Margin compression (operating 8.8%)
