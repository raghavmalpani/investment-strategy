### Scoring (Growth-Focused Framework)
- AI Revenue Growth & Monetization: 5/5 (Weight: 2.0) = 10.0
- Competitive Positioning: 5/5 (Weight: 2.0) = 10.0
- Strategic Moats: 5/5 (Weight: 1.5) = 7.5
- Execution & Regulatory Risk: 3/5 (Weight: 1.0) = 3.0
- Capital Efficiency: 5/5 (Weight: 0.5) = 2.5
- Valuation as Thesis Discount: 3/5 (Weight: 0.5) = 1.5
**Total: 4.60 / 5**

### Key Points
- **AI Revenue:** $165B TTM, 89% from Data Center; massive Blackwell ramp ahead
- **Positioning:** CUDA ecosystem = unmatched moat; Hopper/Blackwell multi-generation lead
- **Moats:** 15+ years of developer lock-in; every major AI lab dependent
- **Valuation reframe:** P/E 52x, PEG 4.1x = thesis ~60% priced in; room for upside if AI capex sustains through 2026+
- **Risks:** China $4.5B exposure; valuation leaves little margin for error

### Trigger Flags
- [x] Export controls ($4.5B China revenue)
- [x] Valuation premium (thesis 60% priced, needs continued beat)
