## Risk Profile
**This is a high-growth, high-risk sleeve.** Portfolio is positioned for AI thesis upside with tolerance for >30% drawdowns. Scoring emphasizes future AI potential over current financial perfection.

## Universal Scoring Dimensions (Total Weight: 7.5)

### 1. AI Revenue Growth & Monetization (Weight: 2.0)
**What we're measuring:** Current AI revenue trajectory and forward pipeline visibility

**Sample Indicators:**
- **Chips:** GPU/ASIC revenue growth YoY, AI backlog quarters, design win pipeline value
- **Foundry/Tools:** Advanced node utilization %, AI-specific customer capex growth, order book momentum
- **Cloud:** Azure/AWS/GCP AI revenue % and growth rate, Copilot/Bedrock adoption metrics, AI deal pipeline

**Scoring guide:**
- **5:** >40% AI revenue growth, multi-quarter backlog, expanding TAM
- **4:** 25-40% growth, solid visibility, market share gains
- **3:** 15-25% growth, in-line with sector
- **2:** <15% growth, decelerating trends
- **1:** Flat/negative AI revenue growth

### 2. Competitive Positioning (Weight: 2.0)
**What we're measuring:** Sustainable advantages in AI workloads vs competitors

**Sample Indicators:**
- **Chips:** Process node leadership, architecture advantages, software ecosystem depth (CUDA-level)
- **Foundry/Tools:** Technology monopoly position (EUV), packaging capacity leadership (CoWoS/HBM), supply exclusivity
- **Cloud:** AI product velocity, custom silicon differentiation, platform lock-in strength

**Scoring guide:**
- **5:** Clear multi-generation lead, irreplaceable position
- **4:** 1-2 generation lead, strong differentiation
- **3:** Competitive parity, niche advantages
- **2:** Playing catch-up, commoditization risk
- **1:** Falling behind, losing relevance

### 3. Strategic Moats (Weight: 1.5)
**What we're measuring:** Durability of competitive advantages and switching costs

**Sample Indicators:**
- Ecosystem lock-in depth (developer tools, frameworks, installed base)
- Long-term contracts and strategic partnerships
- Customer switching costs (technical, financial, organizational)
- Network effects and data moats

**Scoring guide:**
- **5:** Ecosystem lock-in creates 5+ year switching barrier
- **4:** Strong partnerships and high switching costs
- **3:** Moderate moat, some customer stickiness
- **2:** Weak moat, customers can switch easily
- **1:** No meaningful moat

### 4. Execution & Regulatory Risk (Weight: 1.0)
**What we're measuring:** Downside risks that could derail the AI thesis

**Sample Indicators:**
- Export control exposure (China revenue %, advanced chip restrictions)
- Customer concentration risk (% from top 3)
- Supply chain dependencies and execution history
- Antitrust/regulatory scrutiny intensity
- Product roadmap delays or technical setbacks

**Scoring guide:**
- **5:** Minimal risks, strong track record
- **4:** Manageable risks with mitigation plans
- **3:** Moderate risks, some uncertainty
- **2:** High-risk exposure, execution concerns
- **1:** Critical risks threatening business model

### 5. Capital Efficiency (Weight: 0.5)
**What we're measuring:** Financial quality as a risk filter (not primary driver)

**Sample Indicators:**
- ROIC trend (>15% strong, <10% weak)
- FCF/Capex ratio (>0.5 healthy, negative concerning)
- Gross margin trajectory
- Balance sheet health (debt levels, liquidity)

**Scoring guide:**
- **5:** ROIC >20%, strong FCF generation, healthy balance sheet
- **4:** ROIC 15-20%, positive FCF, manageable debt
- **3:** ROIC 10-15%, breakeven FCF
- **2:** ROIC <10%, negative FCF but path to profitability
- **1:** Burning cash with no clear path to profitability

### 6. Valuation as Thesis Discount (Weight: 0.5)
**What we're measuring:** How much upside remains if AI thesis plays out vs how much is already priced in

**This is NOT traditional value investing.** We're assessing opportunity vs risk given our AI acceleration thesis.

**Sample Indicators:**
- P/E, PEG, P/S relative to growth rates
- Market cap vs TAM expansion potential
- Multiple expansion room if thesis materializes
- Consensus expectations vs bull case scenario

**Scoring guide:**
- **5:** Thesis largely unpriced; significant upside if AI adoption accelerates (distressed assets, overlooked plays)
- **4:** Modest premium; room for multiple expansion on execution (fair value with catalysts ahead)
- **3:** Thesis partially reflected; needs solid execution to justify valuation (market consensus)
- **2:** High premium; most optimistic case ~50% priced in, limited margin for error (expensive but not unjustified)
- **1:** Extreme premium; requires flawless execution + TAM expansion beyond bull case (bubble territory)

**Trigger Flags (no score)** | â€” | Sudden capex pullback, geopolitical sanctions, large customer churn, margin collapse >500bps
