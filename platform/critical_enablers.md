# Critical Enablers Scorecard

## Weighting Rubric
| Dimension | Weight | Sample Indicators |
|-----------|-------:|-------------------|
| AI Throughput Elasticity | 1.5 | % revenue tied to AI workloads, backlog conversion speed |
| Pricing Power | 1.0 | ASP trends, contract renewal pricing, competitive intensity |
| Capacity & Lead Times | 1.5 | Manufacturing utilization, order visibility, supply-chain bottlenecks |
| Balance Sheet Capacity | 0.5 | Net cash, leverage ratios, ability to fund expansions |
| Diversification | 1.0 | Customer mix, end-market spread, regional exposure |
| **Trigger Flags** | â€” | Single-customer >30% revenue, rapid inventory build, capex cuts from hyperscalers |

## Watchlist
| Ticker | Name | Primary Hook | Latest Score | Trigger Flags |
|--------|------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| AVGO | Broadcom | Networking ASICs, custom accelerators | | |
| ANET | Arista Networks | 400G/800G switching for AI clusters | | |
| SMCI | Super Micro Computer | GPU server integration velocity | | |
| 000660.KS | SK Hynix | HBM memory supply | | |
| MU | Micron Technology | HBM/HBM3E expansion | | |

| EQIX | Equinix | Interconnection colocation exposure | | |
| DLR | Digital Realty | AI-ready colo footprint, JV capital inflows | | |
| ASX | ASE Technology | Advanced packaging throughput | | |

## Usage Notes
- Monitor backlog vs. capacity commentary to update elasticity and lead-time scores.
- Trigger flags such as hyperscaler capex cuts should prompt immediate review and potential downsizing.
