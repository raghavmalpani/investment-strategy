# Critical Enablers (Networking, Memory, Power, Packaging) Scorecard

## Segment Overview
Critical enablers are the infrastructure components that bottleneck AI throughput: networking fabric (bandwidth), memory/storage (capacity), power/cooling (density), and advanced packaging (integration). Unlike compute chips, these suppliers face concentrated hyperscaler demand and supply-chain constraints that create pricing power and capacity allocation advantages.

## Sub-Segment Classification
- **Networking:** AVGO, ANET, NVDA (cross-ref compute_stack)
- **Memory:** MU (cross-ref compute_stack), SK Hynix, Samsung
- **Storage Infrastructure:** PSTG
- **Server/Integration:** SMCI, DELL
- **Power & Cooling:** VRT, ETN
- **Colocation REITs:** EQIX, DLR
- **Advanced Packaging:** ASX, AMKR

## Risk Profile
**This is a high-growth, high-risk sleeve.** Portfolio is positioned for AI thesis upside with tolerance for >30% drawdowns. Scoring emphasizes future AI potential over current financial perfection.

- Proprietary technology or capacity advantages
- Integration complexity creating stickiness
- Ecosystem lock-in (e.g., CUDA for networking ASICs)

**Scoring guide:**
- **5:** Multi-year contracts, irreplaceable capacity or technology
- **4:** Strong partnerships, high switching costs
- **3:** Moderate moat, some customer stickiness
- **2:** Weak moat, customers can switch
- **1:** Commoditized offering

### 4. Execution & Regulatory Risk (Weight: 1.0)
**What we're measuring:** Supply chain, customer concentration, and operational risks

**Sample Indicators:**
- Customer concentration (% from top 3)
- Manufacturing capacity constraints
- Hyperscaler capex cycle exposure
- Geographic/geopolitical risks
- Inventory management

**Scoring guide:**
- **5:** Diversified customers, robust supply chain
- **4:** Manageable concentration, proven execution
- **3:** Moderate risks, some dependencies
- **2:** High customer concentration (>50% top 3) or supply constraints
- **1:** Critical execution risks, over-reliant on single customer

### 5. Capital Efficiency (Weight: 0.5)
**What we're measuring:** Financial quality as a risk filter

**Sample Indicators:**
- ROIC trend
- FCF/Capex ratio
- Gross margin trajectory
- Balance sheet health (leverage, liquidity)

**Scoring guide:**
- **5:** ROIC >20%, strong FCF, healthy balance sheet
- **4:** ROIC 15-20%, positive FCF
- **3:** ROIC 10-15%, breakeven FCF
- **2:** ROIC <10%, negative FCF but path visible
- **1:** Burning cash, balance sheet concerns

### 6. Valuation as Thesis Discount (Weight: 0.5)
**What we're measuring:** How much upside remains if AI thesis plays out vs how much is already priced in

**This is NOT traditional value investing.** We're assessing opportunity vs risk given our AI acceleration thesis.

**Sample Indicators:**
- P/E, PEG, EV/EBITDA relative to growth
- Market cap vs AI infrastructure TAM
- Pricing in of hyperscaler capex cycle

**Scoring guide:**
- **5:** Thesis largely unpriced; significant upside if AI buildout accelerates
- **4:** Modest premium; room for multiple expansion
- **3:** Thesis partially reflected; needs execution
- **2:** High premium; most optimistic case ~50% priced in
- **1:** Extreme premium; bubble territory
