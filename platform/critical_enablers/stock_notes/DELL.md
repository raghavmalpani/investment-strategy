*AI server infrastructure, liquid cooling*

## 2025-10-05

### Scoring (Growth-Focused Framework)
- AI Revenue Growth & Monetization: 5/5 (Weight: 2.0) = 10.0
- Competitive Positioning: 4/5 (Weight: 2.0) = 8.0
- Strategic Moats: 4/5 (Weight: 1.5) = 6.0
- Execution & Regulatory Risk: 4/5 (Weight: 1.0) = 4.0

- Valuation as Thesis Discount: 4/5 (Weight: 0.5) = 2.0
**Total: 4.27 / 5**

### Key Points
- **AI Revenue:** Infrastructure +44% YoY; AI server backlog $14.4B, orders $12.1B in Q1 FY2026; $101B TTM revenue
- **Positioning:** Broader scale and supply chain vs SMCI; thermal mgmt (air + liquid); AI Factory end-to-end service expanding beyond hyperscalers to enterprise
- **Moats:** NVIDIA certification, comprehensive service offerings, deep supply chain integration; AI software ecosystem partnerships
- **Valuation:** P/E 19x, P/S 0.9x = AI thesis partially priced; significant upside as backlog converts
- **Risks:** Customer concentration (hyperscalers substantial share); GPU supply constraints easing but allocation still key

### Trigger Flags
- [ ] No critical triggers (diversified customer base expanding to enterprise)
