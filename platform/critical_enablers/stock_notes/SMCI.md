# Super Micro Computer (SMCI) - Research Notes

*GPU server integration velocity*

## 2025-10-05

### Scoring (Growth-Focused Framework)
- AI Revenue Growth & Monetization: 4/5 (Weight: 2.0) = 8.0
- Competitive Positioning: 3/5 (Weight: 2.0) = 6.0
- Strategic Moats: 3/5 (Weight: 1.5) = 4.5
- Execution & Regulatory Risk: 2/5 (Weight: 1.0) = 2.0
- Capital Efficiency: 4/5 (Weight: 0.5) = 2.0
- Valuation as Thesis Discount: 3/5 (Weight: 0.5) = 1.5
**Total: 3.20 / 5**

### Key Points
- **AI Revenue:** $22B TTM (+19% YoY); 2,000+ DLC (direct liquid cooling) racks/month; GPU server integration leader
- **Positioning:** Fast time-to-market advantage with modular liquid cooling; faces competition from Dell's scale and supply chain depth
- **Moats:** NVIDIA certification, vertical integration enables rapid cycles; custom rack integration creates stickiness
- **Valuation:** P/E 27x, P/S 1.3x = reasonable given growth deceleration; some AI upside remains
- **Risks:** Margin pressure (gross margin 11%, down from 13%); hyperscaler concentration; GPU inventory write-downs; quality/RMA concerns

### Trigger Flags
- [x] Margin compression (gross margin 11% vs prior 13%)
- [x] Earnings decline (-9% YoY) despite revenue growth
