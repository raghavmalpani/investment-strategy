# Eaton (ETN) - Research Notes

*Power distribution, electrical infrastructure for AI datacenters*

## 2025-10-05

### Scoring (Growth-Focused Framework)
- AI Revenue Growth & Monetization: 3/5 (Weight: 2.0) = 6.0
- Competitive Positioning: 4/5 (Weight: 2.0) = 8.0
- Strategic Moats: 4/5 (Weight: 1.5) = 6.0
- Execution & Regulatory Risk: 5/5 (Weight: 1.0) = 5.0
- Capital Efficiency: 4/5 (Weight: 0.5) = 2.0
- Valuation as Thesis Discount: 2/5 (Weight: 0.5) = 1.0
**Total: 3.73 / 5**

### Key Points
- **AI Revenue:** $26B TTM (+2.7% YoY); AI datacenter electrical infrastructure growing but represents smaller portion vs Vertiv's AI focus
- **Positioning:** Strong power distribution and electrical equipment; broad North America installed base; CHIPS Act datacenter project exposure
- **Moats:** Comprehensive electrical infrastructure portfolio; strong balance sheet; regulatory/sustainability tailwinds for energy efficiency
- **Valuation:** P/E 37x, P/S 5.6x = premium valuation for modest growth; AI thesis partially priced
- **Risks:** Less pure-play AI exposure vs VRT; broader industrial diversification dilutes datacenter growth signal

### Trigger Flags
- [ ] No critical triggers (diversified industrials conglomerate)
