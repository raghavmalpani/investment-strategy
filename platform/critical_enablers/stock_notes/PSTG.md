*FlashBlade for AI datasets, AIRI stack*

## 2025-10-05

### Scoring (Growth-Focused Framework)
- AI Revenue Growth & Monetization: 4/5 (Weight: 2.0) = 8.0
- Competitive Positioning: 4/5 (Weight: 2.0) = 8.0
- Strategic Moats: 4/5 (Weight: 1.5) = 6.0
- Execution & Regulatory Risk: 4/5 (Weight: 1.0) = 4.0
- Capital Efficiency: 3/5 (Weight: 0.5) = 1.5
- Valuation as Thesis Discount: 2/5 (Weight: 0.5) = 1.0
**Total: 3.77 / 5**

### Key Points
- **AI Revenue:** FY2025 revenue $3.2B (+12% YoY); FlashBlade/AIRI adoption with NVDA accelerating; hyperscaler deals shifting to flash-based AI storage
- **Positioning:** AI-native storage architecture leader; AIRI certification with NVDA; Meta and other hyperscaler wins
- **Moats:** Evergreen subscription model (62% of Fortune 500 customers); NVIDIA AIRI partnership; GPU-direct storage optimization
- **Valuation:** P/E 194x, P/S 8x = high premium for modest growth; AI thesis moderately priced in
- **Risks:** Hyperscaler in-house storage competition; NAND flash pricing pressure; low net margin (4%)

### Trigger Flags
- [ ] No critical triggers (diversifying customer base, strong hyperscaler traction)
