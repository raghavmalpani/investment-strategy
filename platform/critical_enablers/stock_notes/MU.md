**Note:** Also scored in compute_stack/Foundry & Tools - cross-reference platform/compute_stack/stock_notes/MU.md

## 2025-10-05

### Scoring (Growth-Focused Framework)
- AI Revenue Growth & Monetization: 5/5 (Weight: 2.0) = 10.0
- Competitive Positioning: 4/5 (Weight: 2.0) = 8.0
- Strategic Moats: 4/5 (Weight: 1.5) = 6.0
- Execution & Regulatory Risk: 4/5 (Weight: 1.0) = 4.0
- Capital Efficiency: 3/5 (Weight: 0.5) = 1.5
- Valuation as Thesis Discount: 4/5 (Weight: 0.5) = 2.0
**Total: 4.20 / 5**

### Key Points
- **AI Revenue:** 56% of $33.8B revenue from datacenter/AI; HBM revenues +50% sequentially; most HBM3E output sold through 2026
- **Positioning:** Strong #3 in HBM behind SK Hynix/Samsung; qualified across NVDA/AMD/Google; sampling HBM4
- **Moats:** Long-term HBM supply agreements; 9-18 month qualification cycles create switching costs; $13.8B capex expansion
- **Valuation:** P/E 30x, PEG 0.91x = AI thesis partially priced; upside remains as HBM ramps through 2026
- **Risks:** Capital intensity ($13.3B capex TTM); trailing SK Hynix in HBM4 timing; memory market cyclicality

### Trigger Flags
- [ ] No critical triggers (diversified customer base, strong execution)
