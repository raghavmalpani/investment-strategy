*AI datacenter power/cooling retrofits*

## 2025-10-05

### Scoring (Growth-Focused Framework)
- AI Revenue Growth & Monetization: 4/5 (Weight: 2.0) = 8.0
- Competitive Positioning: 4/5 (Weight: 2.0) = 8.0
- Strategic Moats: 4/5 (Weight: 1.5) = 6.0
- Execution & Regulatory Risk: 4/5 (Weight: 1.0) = 4.0
- Capital Efficiency: 4/5 (Weight: 0.5) = 2.0
- Valuation as Thesis Discount: 2/5 (Weight: 0.5) = 1.0
**Total: 3.87 / 5**

### Key Points
- **AI Revenue:** Q1 2025 revenue +24% YoY to $9.1B; AI datacenter buildouts driving retrofit/new infrastructure for high-density racks (50-100 kW+)
- **Positioning:** Leadership in air/liquid cooling integration; preferred vendor status across hyperscalers and colo providers; close NVIDIA partnership
- **Moats:** Long-term infrastructure service agreements; mission-critical installation complexity creates switching costs; global field service network
- **Valuation:** P/E 69x, P/S 6.2x = high premium; AI thesis substantially priced in
- **Risks:** Hyperscaler concentration; liquid cooling supply chain fragility; in-house hyperscaler design competition

### Trigger Flags
- [ ] No critical triggers (diversified across hyperscalers and colo)
