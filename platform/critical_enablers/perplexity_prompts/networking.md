# Networking Enablers Research Prompt

I'm researching networking enablers (AVGO, ANET, NVDA) for an AI infrastructure investment thesis focused on AI cluster fabric and interconnect.

**AI Revenue & Monetization:**
- Revenue growth from 400G/800G AI cluster switches and next-gen roadmap (1.6T, 3.2T)
- Custom ASIC design wins for hyperscaler AI networks (e.g., Google TPU interconnect, Meta RoCE fabric)
- InfiniBand vs Ethernet fabric adoption trends in AI training clusters
- Mellanox/ConnectX DPU revenue tied to AI workloads

**Competitive Positioning:**
- Bandwidth leadership and AI fabric optimization capabilities
- Hyperscaler design wins and preferred vendor status (META, MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, ORCL)
- Competitive threats from merchant silicon (Broadcom) vs vertical integration (NVDA) vs cloud-optimized (Arista)

**Strategic Moats:**
- Long-term supply agreements or co-development partnerships with hyperscalers
- Ecosystem lock-in (CUDA for NVDA networking, custom ASIC stickiness for AVGO)
- Switching costs and integration complexity

**Execution & Supply Chain:**
- Lead times and backlog commentary for AI networking products
- Customer concentration (% revenue from top 3 hyperscalers)
- Manufacturing capacity constraints or foundry allocation

Focus on latest earnings calls, AI Day presentations, and hyperscaler capex commentary from the last 90 days.
