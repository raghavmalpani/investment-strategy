# Power & Cooling Research Prompt

I'm researching power and cooling suppliers (VRT, ETN) for an AI infrastructure investment thesis focused on datacenter power density and thermal management.

**AI Revenue & Monetization:**
- AI datacenter power/cooling retrofit pipeline and backlog
- Power density upgrade revenue (kW/rack expansion from 10-15kW to 50-100kW+)
- Liquid cooling adoption trends and revenue contribution
- UPS, PDU, and electrical infrastructure revenue tied to AI buildouts

**Competitive Positioning:**
- Power density capabilities and liquid cooling technology leadership
- Hyperscaler design wins and preferred vendor status
- Competitive threats from in-house solutions or new entrants

**Strategic Moats:**
- Long-term infrastructure partnerships with hyperscalers or colo providers
- Mission-critical infrastructure stickiness and switching costs
- Installation complexity and service network advantages

**Execution & Supply Chain:**
- AI datacenter project pipeline visibility (new builds vs retrofits)
- Customer concentration and hyperscaler capex cycle exposure
- Geographic expansion (US CHIPS Act datacenters, international builds)

Focus on latest earnings calls, hyperscaler datacenter build announcements, and power/cooling innovation updates from the last 90 days.
