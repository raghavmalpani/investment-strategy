# Server & Integration Research Prompt

I'm researching server integrators (SMCI, DELL) for an AI infrastructure investment thesis focused on GPU server assembly and liquid cooling.

**AI Revenue & Monetization:**
- GPU server revenue growth and backlog visibility
- AI-specific rack integration revenue (DGX-equivalent builds, custom liquid cooling)
- Server unit shipments and ASP trends for AI vs traditional servers
- Direct liquid cooling (DLC) adoption and revenue contribution

**Competitive Positioning:**
- GPU server integration speed and time-to-market advantages
- Thermal management innovation (air vs liquid cooling capabilities)
- Hyperscaler vs enterprise AI server mix and competitive positioning
- Supply chain control and NVIDIA partnership status

**Strategic Moats:**
- Long-term supply agreements with hyperscalers or NVIDIA certification
- Custom integration complexity creating stickiness
- Vertical integration advantages (SMCI) vs scale advantages (DELL)

**Execution & Supply Chain:**
- Customer concentration (% revenue from top hyperscalers)
- GPU allocation and supply constraints
- Inventory management and working capital efficiency
- Quality control and RMA rates

Focus on latest earnings calls, NVIDIA GPU supply commentary, and hyperscaler capex trends from the last 90 days.
