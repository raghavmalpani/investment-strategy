# Colocation REITs Research Prompt

I'm researching colocation REITs (EQIX, DLR) for an AI infrastructure investment thesis focused on AI-ready datacenter capacity.

**AI Revenue & Monetization:**
- AI-ready square footage and power capacity committed to AI workloads
- Hyperscaler co-location commitments and leasing pipeline
- Power density capabilities (kW/rack) and AI-specific infrastructure revenue
- Interconnection revenue tied to AI cluster networking

**Competitive Positioning:**
- Hyperscaler proximity and interconnection density advantages
- Power availability and speed-to-market for AI deployments
- Geographic footprint in key AI markets (US, Europe, Asia)

**Strategic Moats:**
- Long-term hyperscaler leases and co-location agreements
- Land/power/fiber rights in supply-constrained markets
- Interconnection ecosystem network effects

**Execution & Supply Chain:**
- AI datacenter development pipeline and capital deployment plans
- Customer concentration (% from hyperscalers vs enterprise)
- Power procurement constraints and grid capacity risks
- JV structures and capital partnership strategies

Focus on latest earnings calls, hyperscaler capacity commitments, and new AI datacenter development announcements from the last 90 days.
