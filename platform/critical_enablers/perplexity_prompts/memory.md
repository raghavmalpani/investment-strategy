# Memory Suppliers Research Prompt

I'm researching memory suppliers (MU, SK Hynix, Samsung) for an AI infrastructure investment thesis focused on HBM and AI datacenter DRAM.

**AI Revenue & Monetization:**
- HBM/HBM3E revenue growth and AI datacenter mix trends
- Forward capacity allocation to AI customers (NVDA, AMD, hyperscalers)
- Next-gen HBM roadmap (HBM3E 12-hi, HBM4) and volume production timelines
- AI server DRAM content growth vs traditional server DRAM

**Competitive Positioning:**
- HBM generation leadership and yield advantages (who's shipping what to whom)
- Market share in AI accelerator memory (NVDA H100/H200/B200 supply splits)
- Technology differentiation in bandwidth, capacity, or power efficiency

**Strategic Moats:**
- Long-term HBM supply agreements with NVDA, AMD, or hyperscalers
- Proprietary manufacturing advantages or capacity constraints
- Qualification timelines and switching costs for new HBM suppliers

**Execution & Supply Chain:**
- HBM capacity expansion plans and capex commitments
- Supply-demand balance and allocation priorities (AI vs consumer/mobile)
- Customer concentration risks and dependency on GPU cycle

Focus on latest earnings calls, technology roadmap updates, and NVIDIA/hyperscaler supply chain commentary from the last 90 days.
