# Advanced Packaging Research Prompt

I'm researching advanced packaging suppliers (ASX, AMKR) for an AI infrastructure investment thesis focused on chiplet integration and CoWoS capacity.

**AI Revenue & Monetization:**
- CoWoS and advanced packaging revenue growth tied to AI accelerators
- Capacity utilization and AI customer allocation (NVDA, AMD, others)
- Next-gen packaging roadmap (chiplet integration, 3D stacking) and AI-specific innovations
- ASP trends for AI packaging vs traditional semiconductor packaging

**Competitive Positioning:**
- CoWoS capacity and technology leadership vs TSMC in-house packaging
- Chiplet integration capabilities and yield advantages
- Geographic advantages (AMKR US presence for geopolitical hedge)

**Strategic Moats:**
- Long-term supply agreements with NVIDIA, AMD, or hyperscalers
- Proprietary packaging technology or manufacturing exclusivity
- Qualification timelines and switching costs for AI chip packaging

**Execution & Supply Chain:**
- Capacity expansion plans and capex commitments
- Customer concentration and dependency on GPU/AI accelerator cycle
- CHIPS Act beneficiary status and US manufacturing expansion (AMKR)

Focus on latest earnings calls, NVIDIA/AMD supply chain commentary, and advanced packaging capacity announcements from the last 90 days.
