# Storage Infrastructure Research Prompt

I'm researching storage infrastructure (PSTG) for an AI infrastructure investment thesis focused on AI dataset storage and training pipelines.

**AI Revenue & Monetization:**
- FlashBlade revenue growth tied to AI workloads and dataset storage
- AIRI (AI-Ready Infrastructure) stack adoption and pipeline visibility
- AI-specific storage product mix vs traditional enterprise storage
- GPU-direct storage and training pipeline optimization revenue

**Competitive Positioning:**
- Technology leadership in AI-native storage architectures
- Design wins with AI research labs, hyperscalers, and enterprise AI deployments
- Competitive threats from hyperscaler in-house solutions or legacy vendors (NetApp, Dell EMC)

**Strategic Moats:**
- Long-term partnerships with NVIDIA (AIRI certification) or hyperscalers
- Integration complexity and data migration switching costs
- Subscription/Evergreen model stickiness

**Execution & Supply Chain:**
- Customer concentration in AI workloads
- Transition from legacy enterprise storage to AI-focused revenue mix
- Backlog and pipeline commentary for AI infrastructure deals

Focus on latest earnings calls, NVIDIA partnership updates, and AI customer case studies from the last 90 days.
