### Key Points
- MI300 strong momentum, hyperscaler design wins building
- $1.5B inventory write-down Q2 crushed margins (43% gross, 9% operating)
- Weak capital efficiency: 4.7% ROE, 3.5% ROIC vs NVDA 81%
- Lacks software moat depth; ROCm ecosystem nascent vs CUDA
- China risk $1.5B; P/E 93x on thin margins = valuation trap

### Trigger Flags
- [x] $1.5B inventory charge Q2
- [x] China export controls ($1.5B revenue)
- [x] Margin compression (operating margin 8.8%)
